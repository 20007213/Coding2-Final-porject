# Coding2-Final-porject

For my final project, I chose to work with python deep learning. I used a generative adversarial network (GAN).

The inspiration for my project came from the fact that I have friends who are colour-blind and colour-impaired. They often can't tell red from green, green from yellow... and it got me thinking, are the colours in the world deceptive? Would what people call red, blue, green... look different to different people? And what colours would it give to the world in the world of machines.

This is how I started my project. My goal was to automatically colour a picture or video. 
At the beginning of the project I tried other ways of doing this, but after searching for information and case studies and experimenting I found that a generative adversarial network was a better way to achieve this goal. I experimented with the ability to automatically colour photos and videos, and also with the camera function for interactive colouring in real time. If you want you can try interacting with it.

As I am still in the initial stages of learning python, there is still a lot of space for improvement in my code. I hope to learn more about deep neural networks in the next semester to improve my project.
